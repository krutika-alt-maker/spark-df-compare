## ✅ **Advantages Over Classic Spark Comparison**

### 1. **Schema Alignment**

**Classic Spark:**
Fails or throws errors if schemas differ or column orders don’t match.
**This Utility:**

* Automatically adds missing columns with `null` values
* Aligns schema before comparing
* Handles `struct` and nested fields gracefully

---

### 2. **Detailed Mismatch Reporting**

**Classic Spark:**
You often compare via `df1.subtract(df2).union(df2.subtract(df1))`, which shows *row-level* mismatches without telling *what exactly differs*.
**This Utility:**

* Shows exactly **which columns differ and how**
* Returns a **summary DataFrame** with mismatch counts per column
* Optionally includes **row-level mismatched values**

---

### 3. **Tolerance for Numeric Values**

**Classic Spark:**
Performs strict equality checks (`==`) which fail for floating-point imprecision.
**This Utility:**

* Supports a **threshold** for `double/float` columns
* Flags only significant numeric mismatches

---

### 4. **Coverage Analysis**

**Classic Spark:**
No built-in way to assess if rows were **dropped or added** between versions.
**This Utility:**

* Identifies dropped and added keys
* Calculates **percentage impact** of additions/deletions
* Returns rows that were added or dropped

---

### 5. **Optional Filtering to Common Keys**

**Classic Spark:**
Requires manual filtering if you want to compare only overlapping keys.
**This Utility:**

* Provides a flag (`local_test_cases`) to **compare only intersected keys**

---

### 6. **Struct & Array Handling**

**Classic Spark:**
Does not sort arrays inside structs → leads to false mismatches.
**This Utility:**

* Automatically **sorts arrays inside structs** before comparison
* Ensures deep equality rather than surface-level

---

### 7. **Safe Defaults & Edge Case Handling**

* Null-safe comparisons
* Handles type mismatches more gracefully
* Provides dummy DataFrames if no mismatches are found (to avoid breakage)
